# Mathom
An archive of my old and unmaintained code released to Public Domain. The name of this repository is a reference to mathom in J. R. R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" - an item which "Hobbits had no immediate use for, but were unwilling to throw away".

Contents:

[Sparx](https://github.com/gecko0307/mathom/tree/master/sparx) - a game-oriented utility library
